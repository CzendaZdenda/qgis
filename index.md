## [[processing64.png]] [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) Processing Framework
In QGIS there are [several analytical tools](http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Analytical_framework), mostly relying on external software. We plan to add a common framework, so every tool will fit in, and all tools could be used either individually or chained together.

In particular, this project aims at the creation of a QGIS plugin that makes it possible to run the versatile "System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis" ([SAGA GIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/)) modules from Quantum GIS. Generates a GUI on-the-fly and run the modules using either the SAGA Python API. Automates the process of information exchange between those two systems.

If you want to help testing the interface, have a look at the [[SAGA Interface HOWTO]] for installation and usage instructions. Thanks!

If you are developer thinking of providing support for your processing library to QGIS, you may want to read the introductory [[Developer's Tutorial]], the [framework's API](http://polymeris.github.com/qgis/processing.html) and/or [[the design document|QGIS Processing Framework]] (a bit outdated, but still relevant).
